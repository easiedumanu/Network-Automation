# Cisco IOS XR Automation Framework

This repository provides a modular Python-based automation tool for configuring Cisco IOS XR routers across multiple services and protocols. It leverages Netmiko for SSH connectivity and JSON-based configuration files for reproducibility, scalability, and operational clarity.

## üöÄ Features

- Multi-device provisioning via IP list
- Modular configuration functions for:
  - IP addressing
  - MPLS LDP
  - OSPF
  - ISIS
  - Layer 2 VPN (VPWS & VPLS)
- JSON-driven configuration inputs
- Exception handling for robust deployment

## üìÅ File Structure

| File                  | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ios_xr.py`           | Main automation script                       |
| `cred.json`           | Stores device login credentials              |
| `ip_config.json`      | Interface IP configurations per device       |
| `mpls_config.json`    | MPLS LDP interface mappings                  |
| `ospf_config.json`    | OSPF area and interface assignments          |
| `isis_config.json`    | ISIS interface and address-family mappings   |
| `vpws_config.json`    | VPWS peer and interface definitions          |
| `vpls_config.json`    | VPLS bridge-domain and VFI configurations    |

## üß† Design Rationale

### üì¶ Why Use JSON Uploads?

This framework uses external `.json` files to define device configurations for several key reasons:

- **Separation of Logic and Data**: Configuration data is decoupled from the automation logic, making the script reusable across environments.
- **Reproducibility**: JSON files serve as version-controlled inputs for auditability and rollback.
- **Scalability**: Adding new devices or services is as simple as updating a JSON file.
- **Security**: Credentials are stored separately in `cred.json`, simplifying encryption and access control.
- **Flexibility**: Each device can have unique configurations without modifying the core script.

### üß© Why This Modular Structure?

- **Granular Control**: Each protocol is configured via its own function.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Isolated logic makes debugging and updates straightforward.
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different modules independently.
- **Future-Proofing**: New services can be added without disrupting existing logic.

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `netmiko`
- `paramiko`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install netmiko paramiko
